# Astro Mind

**Astro Mind** is a friendly AI assistant for *Elite Dangerous* commanders, designed to help you explore and understand the capabilities of ships across the galaxy.

Powered by modern **LLMs** and a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system, Astro Mind combines embedded knowledge with curated data extracted from the [Elite Dangerous Fandom Wiki](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Wiki) to provide detailed answers about ships and their specifications.

Future versions will include role-specific outfitting recommendations, real-time data scraping, and integration with community tools such as [EDSY.org](https://edsy.org/) for direct loadout visualization.

Astro Mind aims to be your co-pilot in the outfitting bay, context-aware, and constantly evolving.
