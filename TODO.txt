- Rework the RAG system and instead of doing HTML -> Structured JSON -> Natural JSONL + metadata, I should do this: 
  1. Extract natural language paragraphs directly from HTML
  2. Split them intelligently into semantically coherent chunks (titles, paragraphs, bullet sections)
  3. Add minimal metadata (e.g., {"ship": "Adder", "source": "in-game wiki"})
  4. Embed that

  It should have the following improvements:
  - Recall and precision of retrieval
  - Reduced need for fuzzy matching or query rewriting
  - Less post-hoc relevance re-ranking
  - Lower hallucination rates in answers
