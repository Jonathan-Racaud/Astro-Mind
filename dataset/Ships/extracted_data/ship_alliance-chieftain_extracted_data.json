{"name": "Alliance Chieftain", "overview_text": "The Alliance Chieftain is very competitively priced, at only 19 million credits it is significantly cheaper than other heavy fighters or multipurpose ships like the Python, Federal Gunship, Imperial Clipper, Krait Mk II, Krait Phantom, and Fer-de-Lance, while offering similar capabilities. The ship also features many internal compartments, allowing the pilot to equip a shield cell bank, hull reinforcements or module reinforcements.[2]\nAs a combat ship, the Chieftain's main competitor is the Federal Assault Ship. Both ships have identical core internal compartments, identical agility ratings (the Chieftain has higher base top speed but lower boost speed), similar defensive capabilities (while it has a stronger shield, the Chieftain offers significantly worse module protection than the Assault Ship) and very similar base price tags. However, the Chieftain has slightly better firepower, its hardpoints are slightly better placed, has slightly better optional internal compartments, and has no rank requirements to meet before it can be purchased, but it is mass locked by the Assault Ship. Chieftain pilots may find it worthwhile to invest in one or more Module Reinforcement Packages, as the Chieftain's thrusters and canopy are particularly vulnerable to focused attacks due to their large sizes and exposed locations.\nThe Chieftain performs very well against its intended match-up, the Thargoid Interceptor. It is capable of equipping the maximum of 4 Anti-Xeno hardpoints and has enough utility and internal space for countermeasures, such as Decontamination Limpets. Finally, the mobility lets it handle Thargon Swarms easily as it can keep a Remote Release Flak Launcher on its target. It is even capable of soloing Thargoid Interceptors in the right hands.\nThe Chieftain is also viable for non-combat purposes. It is a decent trader or pirate ship, as it has a maximum cargo capacity of 122t, which is well below average for a ship of its price but isn't exactly bad either. It is also a very good Mining ship with its medium and small hardpoints, good mobility, small body and cargo space. With 28 LY of jump range, it can get around within inhabited space relatively quickly but still makes for a poor exploration vessel.\nOverall the Chieftain is an extremely powerful ship. Its most notable advantage is its low price, making it accessible early on and also much cheaper to upgrade to its full potential. It is excellent in combat roles like pirating, bounty hunting, and Thargoid hunting, and also retains some of the flexibility of a multipurpose ship.\nThe two Class 3 hardpoints and a single Class 2 hardpoint are aligned along the Alliance Chieftain's central axis, making them suitable for fixed weapons. All three Class 1 hardpoints as well as the two Class 3 hardpoints are also placed above the cockpit, with only the Class 2 hardpoint underneath. Landing gear extends from beneath the front of the ship's hull and the two rear engine nacelles, which rotate.\nThe Alliance Chieftain is most commonly available in Alliance systems. Despite its name and affiliation, it requires no rank or reputation with the Alliance to purchase.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services.
