{"name": "Cobra Mk III", "overview_text": "The Cobra Mk III is an exceedingly popular ship for good reason: it is a small, low-cost multirole vessel capable of performing very well in any role, and essentially serves as a much cheaper Python, making it a good stepping stone for every kind of pilot.\nIn combat the Cobra Mk III is quite potent. It has impressive damage output and defences for its price tier and it is very powerful when outfitted and engineered correctly, making it good at both Bounty Hunting and Pirating. The downside of this ship is the combat ability relative to other ships. For bounty hunters who are attempting to tackle skilled opponents the Cobra Mk III can be outmanoeuvred by Eagle Mk IIs and Viper Mk IIIs, however, its large cargo bay makes it more viable for pirates.\nThe Cobra's carrying capacity, being more than double that of the Hauler and Adder, and its cost, being almost one third that of the Type-6 Transporter, makes it a logical stepping stone for aspiring traders as there is no other ship capable of hauling more cargo at the Cobra's size and cost. If the Cobra Mk IV is not an option then it can remain viable due to its small landing pad requirement. In addition it has much better combat potential than freighters and can defend itself or run away from hostile interdictions.\nThe Cobra Mk III is also a good and affordable exploration ship due to the sizeable 16t Fuel Tank and the amount of Internal Compartments which allows for the placement of the necessary exploration modules such as a Detailed Surface Scanner, a Fuel Scoop and an Auto Field-Maintenance Unit without the need to remove the shield. The downside is its rather low jump range compared to other ships, which averages at 29 LY and can be surpassed by the much cheaper Adder and Hauler.\nAs a miner, the Mk III is very effective. The Mk III's additional hardpoints, compartments, and cargo space compared to the Adder make it very effective at its job, and it can even bring along Limpets due to the extra space. It is an excellent early choice for miners until they can afford a Keelback.\nThe weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two Class 2 hardpoints in front of the cockpit on the upper surface ship, and two Class 1 hardpoints on the underside of the ship. The distance between the two Class 1 hardpoints is sizable, which may cause some trouble when mounting multiple fixed weapons since it is hard to hit with all of them at the same time. The pilot's seat of the Cobra Mk III is to the left of the centre of the ship, and has the co-pilot's to the right.\nMore purchase locations can be found on Inara.cz\n\nAll ships are highly customizable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Cobra Mk III.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Faulcon DeLacy", "years_produced": "3100-Present", "ship_type": "Multirole", "cost": "349,718 CR", "insurance": "17,486 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Small", "dimensions": "27.1m x 44.0m x 7.9m", "pilot_seats": "2", "multicrew": "Yes", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "180 t", "mass_lock_factor": "8", "armour": "216", "armour_hardness": "35", "shields": "92 MJ", "heat_capacity": "225", "fuel_capacity": "16 t", "manoeuvrability": "5", "top_speed": "282 m/s (default) 325 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "403 m/s (default) 464 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "11.16 ly (default) 28.55 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "18 t (default) 64 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "2x Utility Mounts 2x Small Hardpoints 2x Medium Hardpoints ", "internal_compartments": "2x Class 1 Compartments 3x Class 2 Compartments 3x Class 4 Compartments ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "1\n"}], "medium_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}], "large_hardpoint": [], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x8]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x8]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x2]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Advanced Docking Computer", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
