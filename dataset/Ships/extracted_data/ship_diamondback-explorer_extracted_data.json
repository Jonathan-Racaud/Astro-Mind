{"name": "Diamondback Explorer", "overview_text": "The Diamondback Explorer shares the same maximum power plant class limitation as the Diamondback Scout, while having more internal compartments and a larger offensive armament. These factors lead to the Diamondback Explorer having more power management issues with some loadouts. Thanks to the ability to fit a class 5 Frame Shift Drive and a 32t Fuel Tank, this ship is excellent for exploration. Even with a full combat outfit, the ship maintains an impressive jump range. This allows the ship to undertake long distance travel while still being able to defend itself and thus ideal for long-range travel into hostile territory, for Missions, as a forward scouting ship, or as a rescue ship with fuel limpets. Power can be managed with module priority, or in some cases simply disabling the cargo hatch. Additionally, the Diamondback Explorer has excellent heat efficiency and power distribution. The low base heat output translates to better fuel scooping, longer firing cycles for thermal weapons before overheating, easier management of a Shield Cell Bank's heat output, stealth and smuggling, or stealth combat with the ability to maintain silent running for long periods.\nThis ship is quite heavy for its size, and is currently the largest hull mass ship capable of utilizing small landing pads. While this has the benefit of making it harder to mass-lock than similar ships of its size, it makes the ship significantly less agile than its smaller brother, the Diamondback Scout, and even some ships larger than itself. The Explorer is not completely unwieldy, however; with gimballed weapons it can reliably keep weapons on target on all but the most agile of enemies. The Diamondback Explorer is not well suited for mining, as the lack of internal compartment space and higher price when compared to other ships make it a less than ideal mining platform.\nThe weapon hardpoints are located as follows: one Class 2 hardpoint is mounted on either side of the cockpit, and a single Class 3 hardpoint is mounted under the nose. The Class 3 hardpoint has similar field of fire to the nose mount of the Python. Hardpoint locations are grouped together on the fore of the ship's hull, with placement allowing all weapons to be fired at the target simultaneously. If gimballed, the hardpoints provide a large vertical field of fire. Utility mounts are located on the dorsal side of both wingtips, one above the cockpit, and one on the rear tail of the ship, for a total of four.\nAs with the Diamondback Scout, the Diamondback Explorer is equipped with hydraulic, side-mounted thruster assemblies that also contain landing gear. The assemblies move back and rotate downwards when landing gear is deployed.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Diamondback Explorer.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Lakon Spaceways", "years_produced": "3300-Present", "ship_type": "Combat Explorer", "cost": "1,894,760 CR", "insurance": "94,738 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Small", "dimensions": "45.0m x 27.3m x 13.6m", "pilot_seats": "1", "multicrew": "No", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "260 t", "mass_lock_factor": "10", "armour": "270", "armour_hardness": "42", "shields": "131 MJ", "heat_capacity": "351", "fuel_capacity": "32 t", "manoeuvrability": "4", "top_speed": "251 m/s (default) 282 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "328 m/s (default) 369 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "15.70 ly (default) 41.61 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "12 t (default) 60 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "4x Utility Mounts 2x Medium Hardpoints 1x Large Hardpoint ", "internal_compartments": "2x Class 1 Compartments 2x Class 2 Compartments 2x Class 3 Compartments 2x Class 4 Compartments ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [], "medium_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}], "large_hardpoint": [], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x8]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x4]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Advanced Docking Computer", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
