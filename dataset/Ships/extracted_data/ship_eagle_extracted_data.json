{"name": "Eagle", "overview_text": "The Eagle is an extremely agile ship\u2014in fact, it has the highest level of manoeuvrability of any ship, excluding Ship Launched Fighters. Thus, the Eagle is extremely viable for any commander looking to take advantage of mobility, and even high-tier ships like the Anaconda can struggle against a well-trained Eagle pilot due to its ability to stay on the rear of ships, where even Turreted hardpoints won't have any visibility of the ship. Be advised of ships deploying fighters, however; it is highly advised to prioritize these in combat.\nCompared to the Sidewinder, the Eagle is a strict upgrade in virtually every aspect. The Sidewinder has slightly better base armour but the Eagle has much better combat ability due to its high maneuverability and damage output potential. It also has a higher cargo capacity and jump range. The Eagle is a great second ship for players to upgrade to, and some even prefer it over the Hauler for cargo jobs due to its respectable 20t of cargo capacity.\nThe Eagle makes a fantastic Bounty Hunter or Pirate. With its manoeuvrability, the Eagle can take on most adversaries, and with three Class 1 hardpoints, the Eagle is capable of dealing formidable damage. Its high manoeuvrability means it is brilliant at both interdicting and dodging interdictions, making it great for shieldless trading. Defensively, however, the Eagle has very little armour and the second lowest armour hardness of all ships, which causes the Eagle to quickly crumble when under sustained fire. Thus, the manoeuverability of the ship is critical in avoiding hits. A shield is highly recommended, and the low shield power encourages the use of a Shield Booster. The issue with this, however, is that Eagle has only one utility mount, which means forgoing other combat utilities such as the Kill Warrant Scanner. You may wish to instead use a Stealth build; the Eagle has good heat management, and using Silent Running can make it very difficult for opposing ships to land hits, especially if they run Turreted and Gimballed mounts. This isn't a bulletproof strategy, however; experienced commanders may know how to counter it. It's highly recommended to use a Chaff Launcher with this strategy, but once again, this means forgoing a Kill Warrant Scanner.\nAs a Trader or Miner, the Eagle is significantly better than the Sidewinder in both aspects. However, the Hauler may be better for traders if not wanting to touch combat, though you may be better off holding out until the Adder becomes affordable, as it is much better in both aspects while still being viable in combat.\nThe weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two Class 1 hardpoints on the underside of main body of ship, and one Class 1 hardpoint on the top of the ship behind the cockpit. The cockpit is one of the smallest in the Eagle's size class. Whether pilots find the confined space either enjoyable or rather claustrophobic, it does have the drawback of reducing overall range of vision.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Eagle.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Core Dynamics", "years_produced": "3199-3300", "ship_type": "Combat", "cost": "44,800 CR", "insurance": "2,240 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Small", "dimensions": "31.2m x 29.7m x 7.1m", "pilot_seats": "1", "multicrew": "No", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "50 t", "mass_lock_factor": "6", "armour": "72", "armour_hardness": "28", "shields": "78 MJ", "heat_capacity": "165", "fuel_capacity": "4 t", "manoeuvrability": "7", "top_speed": "240 m/s (default) 272 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "350 m/s (default) 397 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "9.15 ly (default) 25.47 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "2 t (default) 20 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "1x Utility Mount 3x Small Hardpoints ", "internal_compartments": "4x Class 1 Compartments 1x Class 2 Compartment 1x Class 3 Compartment ", "reserved_compartments": "1x Class 2 Military Compartment"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "1\n"}], "medium_hardpoint": [], "large_hardpoint": [], "utility_mount": [], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x2]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty (M)", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Advanced Docking Computer", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
