{"name": "Federal Dropship", "overview_text": "The Federal Dropship is generally available for purchase at Stations controlled by minor factions that are aligned with the Federation. Systems controlled by Federal President Zachary Hudson are guaranteed to have the Dropship on hand, along with other Core Dynamics vessels. Its body shape and design is shared with the Federal Assault Ship and Federal Gunship, sometimes making it difficult to tell them apart at a glance. The Dropship is the cheapest of the three and has the lowest Federal Navy rank requirement.\nThe Dropship is a very good combat vessel. Featuring one Class 3 hardpoint and four Class 2 hardpoints, it has no trouble dealing with ships lower than its price and can put up a good fight against even higher tier ships like Pythons. Furthermore, the Dropship has above-average armour as well as two Military Compartments, giving it additional bulk. It suffers from weak shielding and has rather poor mobility, so it is difficult to use against nimble ships like the Vulture. Overall, the Dropship is a respectable ship for both a Bounty Hunter or a Pirate, but more likely to be used as a stepping stone on the path to a stronger vessel.\nAs a trader, the Dropship has 164T of space to haul cargo. This is very good for a medium ship; and is the fifth best of all non-large ships. Combined with its impressive defense, even when unshielded and ability to easily dodge interdictions the Dropship can be a very appealing trade ship. The biggest downside is its very low jump range, especially when fully laden which may make trade options very limited.\nAs an explorer, the Dropship is notorious as one of the worst ships in the role with a poor jump range of 19.66 LY or so, the second lowest jump range in the game, being only a fraction higher than the Federal Gunship. Needless to say, the Dropship is a subpar, cumbersome choice as an exploration vessel, even after engineering.\nThe Dropship is an excellent miner. Four medium hardpoints for one of each mining tool, while retaining a large hardpoint for self defense, small size, great cargo space and good defences make the Dropship a fantastic miner and can be a miner's next stepping stone after the Keelback. Its only downsides are its lack of a Fighter Hangar and its limited jump range, which can make reaching specific mining zones a chore.\nThe weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two side-mounted Class 2 hardpoints in front of the lower wings, two underside Class 2 hardpoints located slightly behind the point at which the front fuselage tapering ends, and one underside Class 3 hardpoint beneath the nose of the ship and slightly forward of the front fuselage tapering. Although all hardpoints have good to excellent fields of fire when fitted with turrets, the side mounted hardpoints benefit the most from turrets.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Federal Dropship.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Core Dynamics", "years_produced": "3300-Present", "ship_type": "Combat, Multirole", "cost": "14,314,210 CR", "insurance": "715,710 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Medium", "dimensions": "73.9m x 52.3m x 21.7m", "pilot_seats": "2", "multicrew": "Yes", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "580 t", "mass_lock_factor": "14", "armour": "540", "armour_hardness": "60", "shields": "104 MJ", "heat_capacity": "331", "fuel_capacity": "16 t", "manoeuvrability": "3", "top_speed": "182 m/s (default) 209 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "304 m/s (default) 348 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "7.25 ly (default) 19.66 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "56 t (default) 166 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "4x Utility Mounts 4x Medium Hardpoints 1x Large Hardpoint ", "internal_compartments": "1x Class 1 Compartment 1x Class 2 Compartment 2x Class 3 Compartments 1x Class 4 Compartment 2x Class 5 Compartments 1x Class 6 Compartment ", "reserved_compartments": "2x Class 4 Military Compartments"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [], "medium_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}], "large_hardpoint": [], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x32]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "6\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x16]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x8]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty (M)", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty (M)", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
