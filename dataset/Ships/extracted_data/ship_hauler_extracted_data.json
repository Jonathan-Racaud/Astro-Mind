{"name": "Hauler", "overview_text": "The Hauler, as its name suggests, was designed to haul cargo for a cheap price and is the trader's equivalent to the Eagle with a capacity of 26T. While this is much better than the Sidewinder Mk I and Eagle, it is still a very low amount and makes it difficult to earn anything more than a small profit from trading runs with regular commodities.\nSurprisingly, the Hauler is a standout exploration ship for pilots with very low budgets. With potential jump ranges reaching around 40 ly with engineering, it can easily become an explorer's best friend until they can trade up for something better. Attempting long-term expeditions with the Hauler make its shortcomings all too apparent, however: low compartment space means the largest Fuel Scoop it can equip is only Class 3, and combined with its small Fuel Tank, pilots can expect frequent long waits while refueling and may be unable to explore areas where fuel stars are few and far between. Furthermore, because the ship is so light, adding even a single ton will drastically reduce its jump range; engineering all internals to be low weight is a must.\nThe Hauler can be a decent mining ship, as it can carry more materials than a Sidewinder or Eagle; but it will mine very slowly due to the single hardpoint. It is generally advised to wait until the Adder becomes an option before mining is attempted, as the Hauler will be forced to make constant runs back to stations and is a very easy target for pirates.\nIn combat, the Hauler is arguably the least viable option among all ships and Ship Launched Fighters on the market. With only a single hardpoint, two utility mounts, terrible shielding, and low armor, the Hauler is incapable of defending against even a stock Sidewinder. Combined with its low Mass Lock, dodging Interdictions becomes a matter of life and death. Despite this, Pirates will occasionally fly the Hauler, but these are generally easy pickings for even beginner pilots.\nThe pilots seat is situated at the front of the ship with a standard view. A single Class 1 hardpoint is located at the bottom of the nose while 2 utility slots are situated atop the rear of the ship.\nThe Hauler's most notable drawback is that it is only slightly less expensive than the Adder, which can carry more cargo than the Hauler while also being capable of defending itself and maintaining more varied capability. While the Adder has less jump-range, it can fit a larger Fuel Scoop and Fuel Tank, and any added mass has less impact on its jump range. It is generally more profitable and viable for traders to simply take a few extra jobs in their Sidewinder Mk I and buy an Adder instead, but explorers should pick up the Hauler as soon as possible, and combat pilots should steer clear of both and pick up the Eagle or Viper Mk III.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Hauler.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Zorgon Peterson", "years_produced": "3300-Present", "ship_type": "Freighter", "cost": "52,720 CR", "insurance": "2,636 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Small", "dimensions": "28.6m x 26.2m x 10.4m", "pilot_seats": "1", "multicrew": "No", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "14 t", "mass_lock_factor": "6", "armour": "180", "armour_hardness": "20", "shields": "65 MJ", "heat_capacity": "123", "fuel_capacity": "4 t", "manoeuvrability": "4", "top_speed": "203 m/s (default) 232 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "305 m/s (default) 348 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "9.87 ly (default) 37.29 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "8 t (default) 26 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "2x Utility Mounts 1x Small Hardpoint ", "internal_compartments": "3x Class 1 Compartments 1x Class 2 Compartment 2x Class 3 Compartments ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [], "medium_hardpoint": [], "large_hardpoint": [], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x4]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x4]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Advanced Docking Computer", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
