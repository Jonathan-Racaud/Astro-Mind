{"name": "Imperial Clipper", "overview_text": "Pilots of any profession may appreciate the Imperial Clipper's high potential speed; with fully upgraded Thrusters, it is comparable to that of smaller ships such as the Cobra Mk III and the Imperial Eagle. Additionally, its pitch rotation and yaw speed are higher than most ships, making it feel like a very hefty, weighted-down Eagle with a Boost Speed that is similar to that of the Cobra Mk III. Its only drawback, and likely the reason for its low overall agility rating, is its poor lateral thruster strength. Combined with very weak shields for its size and wing-mounted hardpoints ill-suited for fixed weapons, the ship is difficult to recommend for combat even with a specialized build. The Imperial Clipper is also one of the widest ships on the market, which can make manual docking complicated for less experienced pilots.\u00a0Compared to the similarly-priced Alliance Chieftain, the Clipper has superior shield strength and cargo capacity, but less overall firepower and weaker armour.\nIts speed and manoeuvrability fall off more heavily when laden compared to other ships, meaning it loses that advantage when trading. Nonetheless, the ship is capable of carrying 248T of cargo, which is impressive given its price point and multirole capabilities. The Type-7 Transporter may be cheaper and can haul more cargo than the Imperial Clipper, but is not nearly as viable as an armed trader that can confront attackers as well as evade them if necessary.\nThe Imperial Clipper is also a good Miner with high cargo and numerous internal slots, but its two Class 2 and two Class 3 hardpoints can be constricting. Taking the Clipper out to mine means either sacrificing damage output to equip the necessary mining tools, or mining with moderate defences and reduced mining efficiency. The ship's large body can also prove problematic when moving in clustered asteroid fields and Planetary Rings.\nWith around 28Ly of jump range potential, the Imperial Clipper is an average vessel for exploration. It is more than capable of doing the job and is a good choice for jobs that require travelling long distances, but ships like the Asp Explorer easily outclass it in this role and cost substantially less.\nThe weapon hardpoints are located as follows: one Class 3 large hardpoint on the top of either wing-tip nacelle, and one Class 2 medium hardpoint on the underside of either wing where the wing attaches to the main fuselage. The wing-tip mounts are very far from centerline and will have trouble converging their fields of fire unless used with gimballed or turret mounted weapons. The underside mounts although closer together, also suffer the same field of fire convergence issues although to a lesser degree than the wing-tip mounts. Due to this, fixed weapons generally are not easy to use with this ship. However, if two fixed weapons are placed on the same side of the ship, it is possible to use fixed mount weapons.\nThe pilot's seat is offset to the right of the centerline of the ship while the copilot's seat is offset to the left of the centerline. Although the ship is compatible with Multicrew, it cannot equip a Fighter Hangar.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Imperial Clipper.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Gutamaya", "years_produced": "3300-Present", "ship_type": "Multirole", "cost": "22,295,860 CR", "insurance": "1,114,793 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Large", "dimensions": "106.7m x 103.7m x 24.8m", "pilot_seats": "2", "multicrew": "Yes", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "400 t", "mass_lock_factor": "12", "armour": "486", "armour_hardness": "60", "shields": "186 MJ", "heat_capacity": "304", "fuel_capacity": "16 t", "manoeuvrability": "5", "top_speed": "306 m/s (default) 341 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "388 m/s (default) 445 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "8.98 ly (default) 27.52 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "74 t (default) 250 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "4x Utility Mounts 2x Medium Hardpoints 2x Large Hardpoints ", "internal_compartments": "1x Class 1 Compartment 2x Class 2 Compartments 2x Class 3 Compartments 2x Class 4 Compartments 1x Class 6 Compartment 1x Class 7 Compartment ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [], "medium_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}], "large_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x64]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "7\n"}, {"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x8]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x2]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
