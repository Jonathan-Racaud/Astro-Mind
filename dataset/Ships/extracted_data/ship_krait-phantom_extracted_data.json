{"name": "Krait Phantom", "overview_text": "The Krait Phantom is a variation of the Krait Mk II, featuring a more streamlined design, revamped thruster configuration and internal layout, and emphasis on speed and manoeuvrability. To the effect of the latter, while the Phantom has the same number of optional compartment slots as the Mk II, the single Class 4 compartment is changed to a Class 3 compartment, and one of the two Class 6 compartments is changed to a Class 5. In addition, Fighter Hangar compatibility, one Class 3 hardpoint, and one of the two Multicrew seats are removed. These changes result in the Phantom shaving off 50 tonnes of mass, allowing it to have a slightly greater jump range and 21 m/s more default speed and boost speed than the Mk II. At the same time, the Phantom's nominal armour, nominal shield strength, and maximum cargo carrying capacity are reduced, and it also has a marginally taller profile compared to the Mk II.\nIn combat, although the Krait Phantom loses some of the Krait Mk II's damage output, durability, and its Fighter Hangar, its higher mobility allows it to become an agile and modestly successful fighter vessel. The Phantom still has two Class 2 and two Class 3 hardpoints, more than enough firepower to be a serious threat to large ships, and when combined with its high mobility, the Phantom can be a very deadly vessel in skilled hands. Overall, the Phantom is a highly effective Pirate and Bounty Hunter, and a solid choice for anti-Thargoid combat.\nThe Krait Phantom has somewhat less utility as a trader than the Mk II due to its lower cargo capacity, though it is still a high amount for a medium ship and its significant jump range can offset this drawback. As a miner, the Phantom also under-performs the Mk II since its reduced hardpoints mean fewer mining tools can be equipped, and its lack of a Fighter Hangar means miners cannot bring Ship-Launched Fighters for defence.\nThe Phantom excels as an explorer, with jump ranges slightly higher than the Asp Explorer depending on outfitting and Engineering, and more internal compartment space for a wider variety of modules. The one notable weakness that the Phantom has compared to the Asp Explorer is its substantially higher purchase price, which makes it more difficult for pilots with limited funds to obtain compared to the latter ship, which remains an effective exploration option.\nThe Krait Phantom's two Class 3 hardpoints are mounted on the vessel's dorsal surface, behind and flanking the cockpit. The two Class 2 hardpoints are mounted on the underside of the front-most points of the hull, on either side of the cockpit and slightly forward. This layout is identical to the Krait Mk II's, minus the latter's third central Class 3 hardpoint. The primary pilot's seat is located squarely along the centerline of the ship, but the cockpit itself extends from the hull and is slightly under-slung, affording a wide, unobstructed frontal view reminiscent of Lakon Spaceways ships. The single secondary pilot seat for Multicrew is placed behind the primary seat.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Krait Phantom.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Faulcon DeLacy", "years_produced": "3304-Present", "ship_type": "Multirole", "cost": "37,472,254 CR", "insurance": "1,873,613 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Medium", "dimensions": "73.3m x 72.0m x 14.6m", "pilot_seats": "2", "multicrew": "Yes", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "270 t", "mass_lock_factor": "17", "armour": "324", "armour_hardness": "55", "shields": "260 MJ", "heat_capacity": "300", "fuel_capacity": "32 t", "manoeuvrability": "3", "top_speed": "256 m/s (default) 290 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "358 m/s (default) 406 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "9.78 ly (default) 34.79 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "82 t (default) 190 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "4x Utility Mounts 2x Medium Hardpoints 2x Large Hardpoints ", "internal_compartments": "1x Class 1 Compartment 1x Class 2 Compartment 3x Class 3 Compartments 3x Class 5 Compartments 1x Class 6 Compartment ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [], "medium_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}], "large_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "7", "max_class": "7"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "7", "max_class": "7"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x32]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x32]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x16]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x2]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
