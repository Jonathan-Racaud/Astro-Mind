{"name": "Mamba", "overview_text": "The Mamba's design draws inspiration from Zorgon Peterson's famed Fer-de-Lance and places an emphasis on bringing heavy firepower and speed to engagements. As both ships have somewhat similar costs and capabilities, deciding which one to purchase over the other comes down to personal preferences.\nIn Combat, the Mamba is the second medium ship after the Fer-de-Lance to be capable of mounting Class 4 weaponry, and the third ship overall after the Fer-de-Lance and Beluga Liner to feature six utility slots. In addition to its single huge hardpoint, the Mamba also possesses two large hardpoints and two small hardpoints. This arsenal places it in a narrow niche above the Fer-de-Lance and below the Federal Gunship in terms of raw damage potential for a medium ship. As a redesigned racing ship the Mamba boasts incredible speed, surpassing most other ships and letting it easily hunt down targets, escape from ambushes, or gain distance for long-range tactics. This comes at a sizeable cost to its turning radius and impacts its ability to maneuver in close quarters, but in compensation, its acceleration is better balanced with its turning rates, making it easier to avoid \"getting caught in irons\", which means accidentally coming to a halt and briefly being a stationary target; this is a chronic problem for pilots of the Fer-de-Lance. The Mamba also has a low heat threshold for its size, but compensates for this weakness with a higher heat dissipation rate.\nLike the FDL, the Mamba is suited to Bounty Hunting and little else as all of the former's drawbacks are only exacerbated here. Featuring a maximum cargo capacity of 64t, which is on the lower side of the spectrum for medium ships, the Mamba is not an ideal choice for a dedicated Trading, Mining, or Piracy vessel. Furthermore, even if all possible measures are taken to conserve weight, the Mamba has a maximum jump range of 20.53 ly, the second lowest maximum jump range before Engineering of all available ships. As a result, when optimised for combat the Mamba can struggle to jump to nearby systems, making travel across even small distances a somewhat frustrating experience. Needless to say, the Mamba is unsuitable for Exploration, especially due to its limited internal compartments. With its higher damage output and extra utility slots, however, the ship still remains an effective anti-xeno choice; in particular, its high speed makes it very effective at dealing with Thargoid Interceptors.\nAll of the Mamba's hardpoints are located on the ship's dorsal surface. The two small hardpoints are forward of the cockpit, the two large hardpoints are on either side of the cockpit, and the huge hardpoint is behind the cockpit. Four of its utility mounts are on its ventral surface, while the remaining two are near the rear of the upper chassis.\nThe Mamba has two pilot seats, giving the ship Multicrew capability. Both seats are positioned on the ship's centerline in a blister-style dorsal cockpit, with the primary pilot seat located at the front, and the secondary pilot seat located behind and slightly elevated.\nAll ships are highly customisable through the Outfitting menu of Station Services. Listed below is the default load-out for the Mamba.\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Zorgon Peterson", "years_produced": "3304-Present", "ship_type": "Combat", "cost": "55,867,041 CR", "insurance": "2,793,352 CR", "expansion": "N/A"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "Medium", "dimensions": "72.2m x 50.1m x 11.4m", "pilot_seats": "2", "multicrew": "Yes", "fighter_hangar": "No", "hull_mass": "250 t", "mass_lock_factor": "12", "armour": "414", "armour_hardness": "70", "shields": "244 MJ", "heat_capacity": "165", "fuel_capacity": "8 t", "manoeuvrability": "3", "top_speed": "316 m/s (default) 361 m/s (upgraded) ", "boost_speed": "387 m/s (default) 445 m/s (upgraded) ", "unladen_jump_range": "6.79 ly (default) 20.53 ly (upgraded) ", "cargo_capacity": "20 t (default) 66 t (max) "}, "outfitting": {"hardpoints": "6x Utility Mounts 2x Small Hardpoints 2x Large Hardpoints 1x Huge Hardpoint ", "internal_compartments": "1x Class 1 Compartment 2x Class 2 Compartments 1x Class 3 Compartment 1x Class 4 Compartment 1x Class 5 Compartment ", "reserved_compartments": "N/A"}, "hardpoints": null}, "outfitting": {"small_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "Pulse Laser (L)", "default_rating": "F", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}], "medium_hardpoint": [], "large_hardpoint": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}], "utility_mount": [{"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "0\n"}], "bulkhead": {"default_system": "Lightweight Alloys", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "8"}, "reactor_bay": {"default_system": "Power Plant", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "thrusters_mounting": {"default_system": "Thrusters", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "5", "max_class": "5"}, "frame_shift_drive_housing": {"default_system": "Frame Shift Drive", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "environment_control": {"default_system": "Life Support", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "power_coupling": {"default_system": "Power Distributor", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "6", "max_class": "6"}, "sensor_suite": {"default_system": "Sensors", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4"}, "fuel_store": {"default_system": "Fuel Tank", "default_rating": "C", "default_class": "3", "max_class": "3"}, "internal_compartments": [{"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x16]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "5\n"}, {"default_system": "Shield Generator", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "4", "max_class": "4\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "3\n"}, {"default_system": "Cargo Rack [x4]", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "2", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Empty", "default_rating": "--", "default_class": "--", "max_class": "2\n"}, {"default_system": "Supercruise Assist", "default_rating": "E", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}, {"default_system": "(PAS)", "default_rating": "I", "default_class": "1", "max_class": "1\n"}]}}
