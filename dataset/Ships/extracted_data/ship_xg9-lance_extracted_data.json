{"name": "XG9 Lance", "overview_text": "In contrast with human-manufactured Ship-Launched Fighters, the XG9 Lance is an all-rounder that relies on its unique Guardian weaponry. It is slightly slower than the F63 Condor, slightly less manoeuvrable than the Gu-97, and has significantly less armour than the Taipan, but its damage output is substantial, especially against Thargoid craft.\nThe Lance's Gauss Focus Cannon is a projectile weapon with the second highest damage-per-shot (94) of all three Guardian hybrid fighters. It has a moderate rate-of-fire and very high armor piercing, but limited ammo, high heat generation, and reduced effectiveness against shields. Of all Guardian fighter options, this makes the Lance the superior choice to inflict hull damage on Thargoid Interceptors. Against non-Thargoid targets that have much lower Armour Hardness values, however, the Lance is less efficient than the other two Guardian hybrid fighters, especially the XG7 Trident.\nBe aware that during combat against a Thargoid Interceptor, its Thargon Swarms will prioritise any Ship-Launched Fighters in the area and quickly destroy them. Eliminate as many Thargon Swarms as possible before deploying a SLF to allow it focus on Thargoid ships unimpeded.\nThe XG9 Lance can be permanently unlocked for purchase by providing the following Materials to a Guardian Technology Broker:\n", "infobox": {"overview": {"manufacturer": "Ram Tah", "years_produced": "3304-Present", "ship_type": "Ship-Launched Fighter", "cost": "15,270 CR", "insurance": "N/A", "expansion": "Elite Dangerous: Horizons"}, "specifications": {"hangar_type": "N/A", "landing_pad_size": "N/A", "dimensions": "15.3m x 12.2m x 11.2m", "pilot_seats": "N/A", "multicrew": "N/A", "fighter_hangar": "N/A", "hull_mass": "N/A", "mass_lock_factor": "N/A", "armour": "10", "armour_hardness": "N/A", "shields": "30 MJ", "heat_capacity": "N/A", "fuel_capacity": "N/A", "manoeuvrability": "N/A", "top_speed": "316 m/s", "boost_speed": "541 m/s", "unladen_jump_range": "N/A", "cargo_capacity": "N/A"}, "outfitting": null, "hardpoints": {"utility_mount": "0", "weapon_mounts": "3"}}, "outfitting": null}
