{"text": "The Eagle is a highly agile combat ship manufactured by Core Dynamics, produced between 3199 and 3300. It is known for its exceptional maneuverability, making it a formidable opponent in combat scenarios. The ship is particularly effective against larger vessels due to its ability to stay on their rear, avoiding turreted hardpoints. However, it is vulnerable to ships deploying fighters. Compared to the Sidewinder, the Eagle offers better combat ability, higher cargo capacity, and a greater jump range. It is suitable for roles such as Bounty Hunter or Pirate, but its low armor and armor hardness require strategic use of its maneuverability to avoid sustained fire. The Eagle's small cockpit reduces visibility, and its default load-out includes specific weapon and utility configurations.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Eagle", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
