{"text": "The Eagle is a combat ship manufactured by Core Dynamics, produced between 3199 and 3300. It costs 44,800 CR with an insurance value of 2,240 CR. The Eagle is known for its extreme agility, having the highest maneuverability among non-fighter ships. It's a popular choice for bounty hunters and pirates due to its mobility and three Class 1 hardpoints for formidable damage output. However, it has very little armor and the second lowest armor hardness, making it vulnerable to sustained fire. A shield and shield booster are highly recommended. The Eagle's small cockpit offers a confined space with reduced vision range. It's a significant upgrade from the Sidewinder in terms of combat ability, cargo capacity, and jump range. The Eagle can also be used for trading and mining, though the Hauler or Adder might be better options for traders.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Eagle", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
