{"text": "The F63 Condor is a Ship-Launched Fighter manufactured by Core Dynamics, produced from 3302 to the present. It is noted for its high straight-line speed, moderate agility, and defenses, contrasting with other fighters like the Gu-97 and Taipan. The Condor is designed as a strike craft that can move in, hit hard, and outrun pursuers. It supports two small hardpoints and at least one utility mount, uniquely allowing it to mount Multi-cannons for increased hull damage. The F63 Condor is available in five variants, differing in weapons, utility modules, and slightly in top and boost speeds. It is the only fighter available with kinetic weapons, with F-variants having fixed weapons and G-variants having gimballed weapons. The Condor is flyable in the CQC Championship and is part of the starter (Rank 1) loadout, coming with two pulse lasers and a Chaff Launcher as default. It can be purchased in Federation systems only but can be restocked in any system.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "F63 Condor", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
