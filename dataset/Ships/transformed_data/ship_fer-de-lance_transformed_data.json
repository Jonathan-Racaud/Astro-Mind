{"text": "The Fer-de-Lance is a combat vessel manufactured by Zorgon Peterson, produced from 3100 to the present. It is renowned for its high damage output and maneuverability, excelling against various opponents, including Thargoid Interceptors and skilled human pilots. Its base shield is the highest among medium-sized ships, and it can exceed 1000MJ of shield with engineering, reaching over 2000MJ. However, it has a low mass lock factor of 12, limiting its ability to mass lock other ships. The Fer-de-Lance is specialized in combat and is less suitable for other roles due to its low jump range and cargo capacity.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Fer-de-Lance", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
