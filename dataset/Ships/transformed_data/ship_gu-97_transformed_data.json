{"text": "The Gu-97 is a Ship-Launched Fighter manufactured by Gutamaya, produced from 3302 to the present. It is known for sacrificing protection for increased mobility, making it challenging for novice pilots but rewarding for experienced ones. It cannot jump to Supercruise or Hyperspace, limiting its operational area to the vicinity of its deployment point. The Gu-97 is prone to spinning out of control upon collisions due to its short length, light weight, and high speed. It comes in 5 variants, differing only in weapons and utility slots, with F-variants having fixed weapons and G-variants having gimballed weapons. The Gu-97 can be purchased in Empire systems only but can be restocked in any system.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Gu-97", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
