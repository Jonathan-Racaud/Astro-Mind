{"text": "The Gu-97 sacrifices protection for increased mobility, making it challenging for novice pilots but rewarding for experienced ones. It lacks a Frame Shift Drive, limiting its operational area to the vicinity of its deployment point. Due to its short length and light weight, it is prone to spinning out of control upon collision. It is available in 5 variants, differing only in weapons and utility slots, with F-variants having fixed weapons and G-variants having gimballed weapons.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Gu-97", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
