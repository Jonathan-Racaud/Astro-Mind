{"text": "The Hauler is designed to haul cargo at a cheap price, with a capacity of 26T. It is a standout exploration ship for low-budget pilots, with potential jump ranges reaching around 40 ly with engineering.

{"text": "As a mining ship, the Hauler can carry more materials than a Sidewinder or Eagle but mines slowly due to its single hardpoint.

{"text": "The Hauler is only slightly less expensive than the Adder, which can carry more cargo and is more capable in various aspects. While the Adder has less jump-range, it can fit a larger fuel scoop and fuel tank, and any added mass has less impact on its jump range.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Hauler", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
