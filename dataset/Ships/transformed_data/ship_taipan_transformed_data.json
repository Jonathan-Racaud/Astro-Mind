{"text": "The Taipan is a Ship-Launched Fighter manufactured by Faulcon DeLacy, produced from 3302 to the present. It is not as fast or maneuverable as some other fighters but has the greatest armor and shield strength, allowing it to absorb more damage and remain combat effective. It lacks a Frame Shift Drive, limiting its operational area to the vicinity of its deployment point. The rear wings adjust based on heat levels, improving heat dissipation but slightly hindering maneuverability until cooled down. It comes in 6 variants, differing in weapons, utility modules, and top/boost speeds, with F-variants having fixed weapons and G-variants having gimballed weapons. It can be purchased in Alliance and Independent systems and restocked in any system.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Taipan", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
