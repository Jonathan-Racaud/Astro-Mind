{"text": "The Taipan is a Ship-Launched Fighter manufactured by Faulcon DeLacy, produced from 3302 to the present. It is not as fast or maneuverable as some other fighters but has the greatest armor and shield strength, allowing it to absorb more damage and remain combat effective. It lacks a Frame Shift Drive, limiting its operational area to the vicinity of its deployment point. The rear wings of the Taipan adjust based on heat levels, improving heat dissipation but slightly hindering maneuverability until cooled down. It is available in 6 variants, differing in weapons, utility modules, and slightly in top and boost speed, with F-variants having fixed weapons and G-variants having gimballed weapons. The Taipan can be purchased in Alliance and Independent systems but can be restocked in any system.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Taipan", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
