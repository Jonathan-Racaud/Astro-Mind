{"text": "The Type-10 Defender is a mighty glacier; slow, heavily armored, and even more heavily armed, it bears the highest armor rating and theoretical damage in the game. In spite of this, the Type-10 is something of a paradox. When compared to similar ships in its price range(the Anaconda, Imperial Cutter and Federal Corvette), the Type-10 has the best armor, but the worst shielding. It has the best theoretical damage in the game, but wide hardpoint placement makes it impossible to effectively use fixed weapons. The ship's huge number of hardpoints seems ideal for turreted weapons, but hardpoint placement means all turrets can only be brought to bear when a target is directly in front of the ship. It has the rare ability to mount a class 8 shield, but less than half the shield capacity of the Cutter, and no ability to mount a class 8 Shield Cell bank. Its improved distributor improves its capability for mining, but reduced cargo capacity equally diminishes that capability. Overall, the Type-10 requires a very different design methodology from other large combat ships. Attempting to use fixed weapons, or to force the ship to rely heavily on shields, will often result in inferior results when compared to other alternatives. Some players equip it entirely with turrets and fly a Ship Launched Fighter, but this, too, is generally relegated to limited roles, such as AFK farming. Some success can be acquired by focusing on its strengths. While turreted weapons on all sides heavily diminishes damage capacity, turrets on a single side allows a player to compensate for its low maneuverability while leaving the other side for higher-damage gimballed weapons. While it shield capacity is low, its shield regeneration is undiminished, and it can take particular advantage from Guardian Shield Reinforcements, which offer nearly twice the benefit when compared to a Cutter. And with the heaviest armor in the game, it has the greatest capability to remain in a fight once its shields have gone down. Taken together, the Type 10 has the capacity to compete with other ships, though not necessarily to defeat them outright.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-10 Defender", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
