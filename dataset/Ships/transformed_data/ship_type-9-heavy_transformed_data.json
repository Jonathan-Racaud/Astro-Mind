{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy is a freighter manufactured by Lakon Spaceways, produced from 3300 to the present. It costs 76,555,842 CR with an insurance value of 3,827,792 CR.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy has a maneuverability rating of 0, sharing this with the Type-10 Defender. It has one of the lowest base speeds among available ships, making it difficult to evade enemy fire due to its large size. However, it can be equipped with a Fighter Hangar to mitigate this. It has five weapon hardpoints for defense, with medium-sized turrets that can force enemy ships to operate cautiously, giving the Type-9 a chance to escape. Its low maneuverability makes it harder to avoid FSD interdictions, often dragging it into combat with hostile ships, which can be problematic for time-sensitive missions. Normal supply missions can be deadly due to its inability to avoid fire from more powerful foes.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "As a trading ship, the Type-9 Heavy has the second-best cargo capacity of all ships, behind only the Imperial Cutter, with a difference of only 4 tonnes. It can downgrade to a Class 5 Shield Generator, making it the best trader with a shield in terms of cargo space. The Imperial Cutter's high repair and rebuy prices, along with the Type-9's interdiction vulnerability, make going shieldless in either case not recommended.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy has a massive fuel tank that can hold up to 64 tons of fuel, giving it a large range before needing to refuel, approximately 100ly when fully laden. This allows it to move around the bubble without a fuel scoop when exploring for new trade routes or trading rare commodities. However, for shorter-range trading, downsizing the fuel tank to reduce weight and increase jump range is advisable.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy has seen niche use as a combat vessel. Although its low number of hardpoints makes its offensive damage lacking, when engineered and turreted, they can deal decent damage. Its dual Class 8 compartments allow both a max level Shield Generator and Shield Cell Bank, making it difficult to take down without engineering. However, fitting both cell banks and a shield generator, along with Shield Boosters, is challenging with the ship's Power Plant. Engineering or a Guardian Hybrid Power Plant, as well as power management, are mandatory for this strategy to function. Upgrading the system's capacity with engineering for the power distributor is also advisable.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy's four utility slots are suitable for Shield Boosters and can help with a lower grade of shield. Chaff Launchers are not advisable due to the ship's size and speed. Point Defence Turrets are also not effective as the large body cuts off half of their range, and the low maneuverability makes it impossible to face the turret in the right direction in time. An Electronic Countermeasure would be a better fit for the Type-9.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "Many pilots have problems fitting through Access Corridors when first getting used to the Type-9 Heavy, which can result in increased expenses in the form of rebuy costs. A Standard Docking Computer or Advanced Docking Computer can be useful for pilots who have trouble docking this ship. It will usually dock the Type-9 no slower than piloting it manually, unlike with other ships. It will also prevent earning Bounties and Fines from hitting other ships, which is quite hard to avoid in a Type-9 even for veterans. The Type-9 Heavy has better maneuverability when stopped, which is handy for docking.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
{"text": "The Type-9 Heavy's weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two Class 2 hardpoints on top of the ship and one more on the bottom, making them excellent for turreted mounts, and two Class 1 hardpoints on either side of the canopy, similar to the Type-7 Transporter. Two of the utility mounts are on top of the ship near the hardpoints, while the other two are found at the back, below the ship.", "metadata": {"entity_name": "Type-9 Heavy", "document_type": "ship", "chunk_type": "overview"}}
